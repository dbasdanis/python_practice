### Hashmap (definition)

A hashmap, also known as a dictionary or associative array, is a data structure that provides a way to 
store and retrieve key-value pairs. It is designed for efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion of
elements based on their keys. In a hashmap, the keys must be unique, and each key is associated with
a value.

The key operations provided by a hashmap are:
- Insertion: Adding a new key-value pair to the hashmap
- Lookup: Retrieving the value associated with a given key.
- Deletion: Removing a key-value pair from the hashmap.

The time complexity of these operations in a hashmap is typically O(1) on average, making
it an efficient data structure for storing and retrieving data by key.

In Python, the hashmap data structure is implemented by the 'dict' class, and it is widely used
for various purposes, inluding indexing, caching, and counting occurrences of elements.

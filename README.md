### 1. Interview Problems

This section contains a curated list of interview problems sourced from LeetCode's "Top_Interview_150" collection. The problems are handpicked to enhance your problem-solving skills using Python. Each problem comes with a detailed explanation and a Python solution.

### 2. Introduction to Python Libraries

In this section, we introduce two essential Python libraries: NumPy and pandas. NumPy provides powerful numerical operations and array manipulations, while pandas facilitates data manipulation and analysis through its DataFrame structure. We'll explore the key functionalities of each library with practical examples.

### 3. Python Datatypes and Concepts

This section covers fundamental Python datatypes such as integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Additionally, it introduces essential Python concepts like control statements, loops, functions, and modules. A strong foundation in these concepts is crucial for mastering Python.

### 4. Introduction to Pytests

Pytest is a popular testing framework for Python that simplifies unit testing. Here, we provide an introduction to pytest and demonstrate how to write effective test cases for Python code. Testing is a critical aspect of software development, ensuring code reliability and correctness.

### 5. Algorithms Implementation

This section delves into various algorithms, including sorting, searching, and graph algorithms. We encourage hands-on implementation to enhance your problem-solving skills and familiarity with algorithmic thinking.

### 6. File Input and Output

File handling is an essential aspect of Python programming. In this section, we learn how to read and write data from and to files. Understanding file I/O is crucial for working with data stored in external sources.

### 7. Error Handling

Python provides robust error handling mechanisms through exception handling. We explore how to gracefully handle errors and exceptions in Python code to prevent unexpected crashes and enhance code stability.

### 8. Object-Oriented Programming with Classes

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental paradigm in Python. Here, we introduce classes and objects and demonstrate how to create and use them effectively to organize code and achieve reusability.

### 9. Multithreading and Processes

Python allows concurrent execution of tasks through multithreading and multiprocessing. In this section, we explore how to utilize threads and processes to optimize performance and tackle concurrent tasks efficiently.

### 10. Test Driven Deployment (TDD) and Business Driven Deployment (BDD)

TDD and BDD are modern development approaches that prioritize testing and requirements gathering. We discuss these methodologies and their benefits in software development and deployment.

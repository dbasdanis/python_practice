# Packages

A package is made up of multiple Python files (or modules), and can even include libraries written in C or C++. Instead of being a single file, it is an entire folder structure.

All Python packages must contain an `__init__.py` file. When you import a package in your script (import packages), the `__init__.py` script will be run, giving you access to the all of the functions in the package. In this case, it allows you to use the packages.hi and packages.woof functions.

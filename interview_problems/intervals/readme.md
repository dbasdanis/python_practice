### Intervals

In programming and mathematics, intervals refer to a range or a segment of values between two points.
An interval is typically represented by start point and an end point, and it can be either inclusive
or exclusive of the endpoints.

Intervals are commonly used to represent a set of real numbers, integers, or any other ordered data. 
They are useful in various algorithms and applications, such as interval arithmetic, data analysis,
and scheduling.

Intervals can be one-dimensional. representing a range along a single axis, or multi-dimensional, 
representing a range in multiple dimensions. The specific preperties and operations associated 
with intervals depend on the context in which they are used.

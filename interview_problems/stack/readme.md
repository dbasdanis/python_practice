# Stack

A stack is an abstract data type that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It is a linear
data structure where elements are added and removed from the saem end, which is referred to as the top
of the stack.

In a stack, elements can only be inserted or removed from the top. This means that the most recently
inserted element is the first one to be removed. 
The operations commonly associated with a stack are:

- Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Removed and returns the top element from the stack.
- Peek or Top: Returns the top element from the stack without removing it.
- IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty.
- Size: Returns the number of elements currently in the stack.

Stacks can be implemented using various data structures such as arrays or linked lists. The choice of 
implementation depends on the requirements and constraints of the problem at hand.

    "# Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum (hard)\n",
    "\n",
    "A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.\n",
    "\n",
    "The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.\n",

    "Example 1:\n",

    "Input: root = [1,2,3]\n",
    "Output: 6\n",

    "Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]\n",

    "Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42."

    "The idea is to use the breadth-first-search (BFS) approach to traverse the tree level by level. We start with the root node and add it to a queue. Then, we loop through the queue and process each node in the order they ere added. For each node, we check if it has a left child and a right child. If it does, we set its next pointer to the next node in the queue. If it doesn't, we set its next pointer to None. Then, we add its left and right children to the queue if they exist.\n",

    "The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, since we visit each node exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n), since we store all nodes in the queue."
